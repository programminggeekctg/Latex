\chapter*{\centering\vfill Acknowledgments}

This internship was, as expected, a great opportunity to discover a new country, the Netherlands, and to learn a lot. Therefore, I want to express my deepest gratitude to:

\bigskip

\textbf{Wienke \textsc{Giezeman}} for this internship offer and his warm welcoming within his startup. As a great entrepreneur and CEO, his positive attitude is a real strength. He perfectly knows how to motivate someone. He is a natural born leader, always pushing further everyone's limits.

\bigskip

\textbf{Pierre \textsc{Van de Velde}} for his everyday help, his kindness, and the confidence he had in me. His sense of leadership makes him an excellent CTO. His experience and guidance allowed me to learn a lot. A great ambitious guy playing a key role in the company.

\bigskip

\textbf{Matthias \textsc{Benkort}}, my friend, colleague and housemate. Always ready to help and share his knowledge, he is very skilled and extremely motivated. He is one of those people interested in everything. He truly is inspiring. He loves challenging himself everyday, which I greatly appreciated.

\bigskip

\textbf{Wessel \textsc{Versluis}}, our crazy designer (in a good way), for making life a big joke! He was the one bringing us joy, as soon as he would come in to the office. Nonetheless, he proved us to be highly competent. I will definitely miss him.

\bigskip

\textbf{All the people at Rockstart}. Without them, no crazy foosball matches, no tasty sandwiches and more importantly, no great coworkers!

\bigskip

\textbf{St√©phane \textsc{Mottelet}}, for his availability and help. He was the link between the UTC and myself, all along.

\bigskip

\textbf{Every person I had the chance to meet in Amsterdam} for making my life so beautiful for six months. Amsterdam is a great multicultural city, full of places to explore, things to see. Thank you, Amsterdamers.
